# FloatingActionButton
Material Floating Action Button (FAB) with Snackbar


Android [Floating Action Button](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/FloatingActionButton.html) is another interesting component introduced in material design. The floating action button floats on UI in a circular shape with an action attached to it. You can find complete information about floating action button behaviour, transitions and other specs [here](https://material.io/guidelines/).

[Snackbar](https://www.google.co.in/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html) are just like Toast messages except they provide action to interact with. Snackbar will be displayed at the bottom of the screen and can be swiped off in order to dismiss them.
